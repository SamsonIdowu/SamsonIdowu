# Hi, I am Samson Idowu üëãüèΩ
### An experienced Cybersecurity Engineer and Researcher with an Msc degree in Security and Network Engineering from Innopolis University.

- I love to spend time on security research in the areas of; application security, systems security, network security, forensics and DevSecOps.

- I have several industry-standard certifications; but I focus my time and energy on learning new skills rather than trying to write exams, as I believe that the one true validation for my skills is DELIVERY.

- I am a skilled Network Engineer (Cisco), System Administrator (Windows & Linux), Penetration Tester, proficient in identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in systems and networks. I have a long array of tools I am proficient with; however, I will spare you the misery of reading them.

- In recent times, I spend a handfull of my time on DevSecOps projects, while working closely with development teams to integrate security into the software development lifecycle.

- Currently, I am collaborating on several research projects and hope to work with you someday.

- üí¨ Ask me about anything security and operations, most specifically: **Vulnerability management, Threat Modelling, DevOps, Penetration testing, Security Monitoring (SIEM), Infrastructure, Routing & Switching, LAN/WAN operations, System Administration, Cloud Infrastructure (AWS & Azure), Virtualization, Container Orchestration (Kubernetes), Docker, CI/CD, IaaC, Network Security, SAST/DAST**
