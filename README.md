# Hi, I am Samson👋🏽
**An experienced Cybersecurity Engineer and Researcher with an Msc degree in Security and Network Engineering from Innopolis University.**

Picture this; it's 2 AM and the company's servers are down, exposing sensitive data to potential attacks. As a DevOps, Cybersecurity, and Infrastructure Engineer, I am driven by the urgency to restore operations, protect valuable assets, and prevent future breaches. 

It's not just a job, it's my passion.


### **About Me:**

- 👀 *I love to spend time on security research in the areas of; application security, systems security, network security, forensics and DevSecOps.*

- 🙄 *I hate reading other people's code.*

- 💪 *I have several industry certifications; but I prefer to focus my time and energy on learning new skills rather than trying to write exams, as I believe that the one true validation for my skills is **DELIVERY**.*

- 👌 *I am a skilled Network Engineer (Cisco), System Administrator (Windows & Linux), Penetration Tester, proficient in identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in systems and networks.*

- 🙊 *I have a long array of tools I am proficient with; however, I will spare you the misery of reading through them.*

- :v: *In recent times, I spend a handful of my time on DevSecOps projects, as i emjoy working closely with development teams to integrate security into the software development lifecycle.* 


**Currently, I am collaborating on several research projects and hope to work with you someday.**
