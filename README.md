## Hi, I am Samson Idowu üëãüèΩ


An experienced Cybrsecurity Engineer and Researcher who is currently pursuing an Msc degree in Security and Network Engineering at Innopolis University. I have a solid technical background in operatiions which has seen me wear different hats iin the course of my career. 

I love to spend time on security research in the areas of; application security, systems security, network security, forensics and DevSecOps.

I have several industry-standard certifications; but I focus my time and energy on learning new skills rather than trying to write exams, as I believe that the one true validation for my skills is DELIVERY.

In addition to my infrastructure experience, I am a skilled Penetration Tester,  proficient in identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in systems and networks. I also engage in DevSecOps projects, while working closely with development teams to integrate security into the software development lifecycle.

- Currently, I am collaborating on several research projects and hope to work with you someday.
